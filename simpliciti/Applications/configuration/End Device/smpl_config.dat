# Number of connections supported. Each connection supports bi-directional
# communication.  Access Points and Range Extenders can set this to 0 if they
# do not host End Device objects.
#--define=NUM_CONNECTIONS=2
# [BM] Only allow 1 connection to RF access point
--define=NUM_CONNECTIONS=1

# Size of low level queues for sent and received frames. Affects RAM usage

# AP needs larger input frame queue if it is supporting store-and-forward
# clients because the forwarded messages are held here.
--define=SIZE_INFRAME_Q=2

# The output frame queue can be small since Tx is done synchronously. Actually
# 1 is probably enough. If an Access Point device is also hosting an End Device 
# that sends to a sleeping peer the output queue should be larger -- the waiting 
# frames in this case are held here. In that case the output frame queue should 
# be bigger.
--define=SIZE_OUTFRAME_Q=2

# This device's address. The first byte is used as a filter on the CC1100/CC2500
# radios so THE FIRST BYTE MUST NOT BE either 0x00 or 0xFF. Also, for these radios
# on End Devices the first byte should be the least significant byte so the filtering
# is maximally effective. Otherwise the frame has to be processed by the MCU before it
# is recognized as not intended for the device. APs and REs run in promiscuous mode so
# the filtering is not done. This macro intializes a static const array of unsigned
# characters of length NET_ADDR_SIZE (found in nwk_types.h). The quotes (") are
# necessary below unless the spaces are removed.
--define=THIS_DEVICE_ADDRESS="{0x79, 0x56, 0x34, 0x12}"

--define=END_DEVICE

# For polling End Devices we need to specify that they do so. Uncomment the 
# macro definition below if this is a polling device. This field is used 
# by the Access Point to know whether to reserve store-and-forward support 
# for the polling End Device during the Join exchange.
